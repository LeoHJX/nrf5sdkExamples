this example once for SDK14.1.0. It prints the throughput in the log. Connect to your phone with nRF Connect, and enable notifications on the TX Characteristic, and the nRF should print the throughpt every second or so. 

If you want to use a later SDK, you can look at this one for inspiration, and port it to SDK16.
